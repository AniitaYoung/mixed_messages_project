#Mixed Messages Off Platform Project
####This project has been created from scratch with JavaScript, CSS & HTML to create a mixed messaged generator programe. So that when a user runs a program a new randomized output (message) appears.

####*My intention is to generate jokey inspirational messages*

##Project Objectives
-Build a message generator program using JavaScript
-Use Git version control
-Use command line 
-Develop locally on your computer


###My Initial Project Plan
#####My initial question is what does it mean when referring to a program, is this on a local computer and simply opening something like a Word Document, or is this referring to a website or opening a web browser? If the above then I have the following plan: 
1. Find out how to write JS code for acknowledging that a program on a local users computer is being clicked on or loaded
2. Once I have found out the above, I can then start writing the code with switch statements 
3. I would also need to use the math floor and math random to generate a random number which I would assign to an output
4. As I understand this project should contain three random answers, so the above JS code would only need to create a random number between 1, 2 or 3
5. Once I have written the above code I can then assign each of the three numbers to one of the jokey inspirational messages I have created.

>I am unsure if this needs HTML & CSS as it could also just be a pop up window that contains the random message so I think to make things simpler for now, I shall not use HTML or CSS.
