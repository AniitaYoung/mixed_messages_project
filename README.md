# Mixed Messages Off Platform Project
#### This project has been created from scratch with JavaScript, CSS & HTML to create a mixed messaged generator programe. So that when a user runs a program a new randomized output (message) appears.

#### *My intention is to generate jokey inspirational messages*

## Project Objectives
-Build a message generator program using JavaScript
-Use Git version control
-Use command line 
-Develop locally on your computer


### My Project Plan
##### I will have three sets of data per output, each random answer will be an object that links the three arrays. I will also try to keep the beginning or part of the message the same for each random output. 

### Below is my initial thought process before fully grasping the project. I wanted to keep this in here as it shows my logic in working through to find a solution to a problem that was this project. 
1. Find out how to write JS code for acknowledging that a program on a local users computer is being clicked on or loaded
2. Once I have found out the above, I can then start writing the code with switch statements 
3. I would also need to use the math floor and math random to generate a random number which I would assign to an output
4. As I understand this project should contain three random answers, so the above JS code would only need to create a random number between 1, 2 or 3
5. Once I have written the above code I can then assign each of the three numbers to one of the jokey inspirational messages I have created.

>I am unsure if this needs HTML & CSS as it could also just be a pop up window that contains the random message so I think to make things simpler for now, I shall not use HTML or CSS.
